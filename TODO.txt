can we add an apt-get autoremove function to the upgrade step in a functional way?
check if "needrestart" can be used in a smart way after update. Seems that needrestart after some testing only need to be installed to work, further testing needed though. Does it work remotley.
checkout sudo apt-get -o Dpkg::Progress-Fancy="1" install "package" for some extra flare.
